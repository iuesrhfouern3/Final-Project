<h1> Attractions in North and South America</h1>
<h3>There are many attracions in North and South America.
  To begin, let's start in South America. One of the places
  you should visit is The River of Five Colours in Colombia.
  This place is colorful and includes different types of
  plants. Besides having all of this, there are also no fish
  or other creatures so you could swim in the water. This
  place is most colorful in the months of July through November. </h3>

<h3> Another place worth visiting in South America is Angel
  falls in Venezuala. This extraordinary waterfall falls at
  979 meters from the top, but the longest uninterrupted
  drop is 807 meters. The falls come from the Carro river
  and fall off near the submit of the Auyan-tepu mountain.
  The falls are located in the Guayana highlands, the second
  biggest national park in Venezuela and sixth in the world.
  The mountain was named after Jimmy Angel who, with his
  parter, flew and saw the falls in 1933. He then returned
  with his friends and wife and, when they traveled to the
  bottom after their plane got stuck, got the falls named
  after him.</h3>
