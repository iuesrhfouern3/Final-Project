<h1> Attractions in Europe and Austrailia</h1>
<h3> One of the greatest natural wonders in Europe are the Faroe
  Islands. These islands, located off the coast of Denmark, are
  a self driven country that is in the Kingdom of Denmark. Although
  this island is near the North Pole, tempuratures are above
  freezing due to the Gulf Stream. The island's name in Danish
  means, "the islands of sheep." The Faroe islands also compete
  in certain sports with their own national team. </h3>

  <h3> Another one of most beautiful places you could visit in Europe
    is the Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia. This place
    has 16 lakes linked together by streams and waterfalls.
    Everything comes together like jewels and it seems as if
    every turn is and introduction to a new shade of blue or
    green. The lakes were founded in 1949 and they are in the
    largest national park in Croatia. The lakes are formed from
    pools and holes in the mountainsides. The two biggest lakes
    are the first lake and the twelfth lake. Below you will find
    a picture of the falls</h3>

<h3>  Now, going into Austrailia, we can visit the greatest wonder
  in Austrailia which is the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier
  Reef stretches for about 3000 kilometers, and at it's widest
  stretches to about 65 kilometers. It has a collection of about
  400 differnt types of coral and also features over 1500 species
  of fish, 200 species of birds, and around 20 types of reptiles.
  The reef is also home to clams, some at over 120 years old. This
  remarkable place is also home to some endangered speciec such as
  the large Green Sea Turtle. At over 500,000 years old, the Great
  Barrier Reef is also a migration spot for whales coming from the
  Antarctic. </h3>
